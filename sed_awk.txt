seq command

	sed is a stream editor. Basically it is editor for stream of data, coming from either a file or a 
pipe or the keyboard. It is capable of processing lines from the file. The lines to be processed 
can be 'addressed' using line-numbers or specifying some string to be found in the line. What 
processing needs to be done on that line is specified by the commands defined by sed.  

One thing to be remembered is, when sed operates on a file, it operates on the stream of data 
coming from the file. It does not change the contents of the original file unless asked it to do so 
explicitly. 

Another thing to remember is, sed operates on whole line. So it is not much useful if you wish 
to cut the line in various sections and process each section separately. For such a need you will 
need to use 'awk'. In some ways, sed can be seen as less capable than awk, but to understand 
awk better, sed must be understood first.
