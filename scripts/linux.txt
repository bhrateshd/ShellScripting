=========
Linux OS
=========

=> Where we will use linux os in real-time

	=> Jenkis Server
	=> Docker Server
	=> K8S cluster
	=> SonarQube server
	=> Nexus Server
	=> ELK stack
	=> Grafana & Promethues servers
	=> Ansible server

=============
What is OS ?
=============

=> It is a software which acts as mediator between user and computer.

=> Users will communicate with computers using OS

=> Without OS we can't use any computer

=> OS provides platform to run our applications in computer.

	Ex: notepad, calculator, browser, tomcat....

=> We have several operating systems in market

	Ex: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, IOS etc...	

===========
Windows OS
===========

=> Developed by Microsoft company (Bill Gates)

=> Windows os is licensed (commercial)

=> Windows is single user based os

=> Security features are less in windows os (anti virus s/w required)

=> Windows is GUI based (graphical user interface)

=> Windows is recommended for personal use

	Ex: watch movies, play games, online classes....

==========
Linux OS
==========

=> Linux is community based os (not specific to any company)

=> Linux is free and open source os

=> Linux is Multi User based OS

=> Linux is highly secured (anti virus is not required)

=> Linux is CLI based os (command line interface)

=> Linux is highly recommended for business use (servers management)

	Ex: App Servers, DB servers, jenkins, docker, k8s, nexus....

==============
Linux History
==============

=> Linux OS developed by "Linus Torvalds"

-> Linus Torvalds identified some challenges/issues in Unix OS

-> Linus Torvalds identified one OS which is matching with his ideas 

			i.e Minux os	

-> Linus Torvalds used Minux OS code and made some changes and released into market as new OS i.e Linux OS.

		(Li) nus + Mi (nux) = Linux

======================
Linux Distributions
======================

-> Linus Torvalds provided Linux OS source code for free of cost

-> So many companies downloaded Linux OS source code and modified according to their requirement and released into market with their brand names

Those are called as Linux Distributions/ Linux Flavours.

-> We have 200+ Linux Distributions in the market.

	Ex: Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Red HAT, suse, debian, kali, fedora....

=============================
How to setup Linux Machine ?
=============================

Approach-1 : Download and Install Linux OS in our System.

Approach-2 : Use Virtual Box and install Linux os as guest os

Approach-3 : Setup Linux VM in AWS Cloud for free of cost

			 (1 year & monthly 750 hours you can use)

		# print lines which contains teen keyword
[O		grep 'teen' abc.txt

		# ignore case sentiveness
		grep -i 'teen' abc.txt

		# print lines contains teen with line number
		grep -n 'teen' abc.txt

=======================
Text Editors in Linux
=======================

=> vi (visual editor) it is default editor in linux machines

=> Using 'vi' we can create new files and we can modify existing file data.

=> vi command is having 3 modes

    1) command mode  (just to open the file)  

    	Ex: vi <filename>

    2) insert mode (to edit the file ) ---> press 'i' in keyboard

    3) esc mode (to comeout from insert mode) --> press 'esc' in keyboard


    ## Save changes & close the file =>  :wq
    
    ## Without saving changes close the file => :q!


Note: vi command will open the file if it is avilable otherwise it will create new file and it will open that file.

========================
file creation commands
=======================

touch : to create empty file
cat  : create file with data
cp : copy one file data into another file (cp f1.txt f2.txt)
vi : create and open file for editing (vi f3.txt)

=============
SED Command
=============

=> SED stands for stream editor

=> SED is used to process the data (substitute, delete, print, insert)

=> Using SED command we can perform operations on the file without opening the file.

=> SED is very powerful command in linux


# replace first occurance of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/' data.txt

# replace second occurance of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/2' data.txt

# replace 3rd occurance of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/3' data.txt

# replace all occurances of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/g' data.txt

# substitute and save changes in original file
sed -i 's/linux/unix/g' data.txt

# delete first line of the file
sed -i '1d' data.txt

# delete fourth line of the file
sed -i '4d' data.txt

#delete last line of the file
sed -i '$d' data.txt

# delete data from nth line to last line
sed -i 'n,$d' data.txt

Note: n is a number

# delete data from 5th line to 15th line
sed -i '5, 15d' data.txt

# print data from line number 10 to 20
sed -n '10,20p' data.txt

# insert data at 2nd line
sed '2i\i love india' data.txt

# insert data at last line
sed '$a\i am from ashokit' data.txt

=================
User Management
=================

=> Linux is a multi user based OS

=> Multiple users can acces single linux machine and can perform multi tasking at time.

Note: "ec2-user" is a default user in amazon linux vm. ec2-user having sudo priviliges.

=> Within one linux machine we can create multiple user accounts

=> when we create user account, for user one home directory will be created.

		ec2-user => /home/ec2-user

		john => /home/john

		smith => /home/smith

# create user
sudo useradd <uname>

# set password for user & update pwd for user
sudo passwd <uname>		

# display all users created
cat /etc/passwd

# swith user account
su <uname>

# navigate to current user home directory
cd ~

# Delete user
$ sudo userdel <uname>

# Delete user along with user home directory
$ sudo userdel <uname> --remove

# how to change username
$ sudo usermod -l <new-name> <old-name>



/etc/passwd: Contains general user information.
/etc/shadow: Contains hashed passwords and other security-related information.

===================================
Working with user groups in linux
===================================

=> When we create user in linux, for every user one user group also will be created with the given username.

# Display all groups in linux
$ cat /etc/group

# Create group in linux
$ sudo groupadd <group-name>

# Adding user to group
$ sudo usermod -aG <group-name> <username>

# Remove user from the group
$ sudo gpasswd -d <username> <group-name>

# display users belongs to a group
$ sudo lid -g <group-name>

# display user belongs to which groups
$ id <username>

# delete group
$ sudo groupdel <group-name>

# changing group name
$ sudo groupmod -n <new-name> <old-name>


=======================================================================================
Assignment : create new user and connect with linux vm using newly created user account
=======================================================================================

###############
12-July-2024
###############

=> In linux, to enable password based authentication we need to modify below 2 files

		1) sudoers
		2) sshd_config

=================================
What is sudoers file in Linux
=================================

=> It is very important configuration file in linux machine.

=> Using this file we can control which user can run command as a superuser.

# print sudoersfile content
$ sudo cat /etc/sudeors

Note: We should be very careful while working with sudoers file. If we do any mistakes in sudoers file then system will be crashed.


########## Giving sudo previliges for user #######

# open sudoers file
$ sudo visudo

# Add below line
<username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

=> After making changes to close sudoers file =>  ( CTRL + X + Y + Enter)

========================================================
How to enable password based authentication for users ?
========================================================

=> In linux vm, by default passwordauthentication is no

=> If we want to connect with linux vm using username and password then we need to set that value as yes.

=> WE WLL MODIFY THIS IN "sshd_config" file.

# Display sshd_configurration file data
$ sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Open file
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Note: Go to insert mode and enable pwdbasedauthentication as yes

# restart sshd service
# sudo systemctl restart sshd

Note : Now we can connect with linux vm using username and pwd

$ ssh username@public-ip

==========================
File Permissions in Linux
==========================

=> Using file permissions we can secure our files and we can protect our file data.

=> We have 3 types of permissions in linux

		r => read

		w => write

		x => execute

=> file/directory permissions will be represented like below

		rwxrwxrwx f1.txt

=> file permissions contains in 9 characters

		first 3 characters => user/owner permissions

		middle 3 characters => group permissions

		last 3 characters => others permissions


		r--r-xr--  f2.txt

			user : read
			group : read + execute
			others : read

		r-xrw--w-  f3.txt		

			user: read + execute
			group: read + write
			others : write

=> To change file/directory permissions we will use 'chmod'	command

			+ => add 

			- => remove

# Giving execute permission for user
$ chmod u+x f1.txt

# giving write permission for group
$ chmod g+w f1.txt

# Remove execute permission for others
$ chmod o-x f1.txt

# Removeall permissions for others
$ chmod o-rwx f1.txt

# give all permissions for group
$ chmod g+rwx f1.txt			

====================================
File Permissions in Numeric Format
====================================

0 => no permissions

1 => Execute

2 => Write

3 => (2+1) => Write + Execute

4 => Read

5 => (4 + 1) => Read + Execute

6 => (4+2) => Read + Write

7 => (6+1) => Read + Write + Execute


# ugo+x
$ chmod 111 f1.txt

# ugo+w
$ chmod 222 f1.txt

# u+rwx, g+rw o+rx
$ chmod 765 f1.txt

# u+r, g+rx, o+rw
$ chmod 456 f1.txt

# u+rwx, g+rwx, o+rwx
$ chmod 777 f1.txt

# u-rwx, g-rwx, o+rwx
$ chmod 7 f1.txt

===============
chown command
===============

=> It is used to change file/directory ownership

# change owner
sudo chown new-owner file/directory

# change owner-group
sudo chown :new-group file/directory

# change owner & group of file/directory
sudo chown new-owner:new-group file/directory

============================================
Q) What is the diff between chmod & chown ?
============================================

chmod => To change file/directory permissions

chown => To change owner/group

=============================================
How to find the location of files in linux?
=============================================

=> in linux we can use 'find' command to search file paths.

# search for the files which are having name as f1.txt
sudo find /home -name f1.txt

# search for empty files inside /home
sudo find /home -type f -empty

# search for empty directories inside /home
sudo find /home -type d -empty

# print 30 days old files in linux vm
sudo find /home -mtime 30 -print

# print 1 day old files in linux vm
sudo find /home -mtime 1 -print

# delete 30 days old files in linux vm
sudo find /home -mtime 30 -delete


=================================
Working with Zip files in linux
=================================

=> Zip is used for files archieve (compress)

## syntax to create zip file : $ zip <zip-file-name> <content>

# create some empty files
touch f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt

# create zip file with content
zip ashokit_data *.txt

# unzip the zip file
unzip ashokit_data.zip

======================
Networking commands
======================

ping : To check connectivity
		ping 192.168.23.321

wget : It is used to download files from internet
		wget <url>		

curl : It is used to send HTTP request to server

		curl https://type.fit/api/quotes

ifconfig : To get ip address of the machine

Package Managers in Linux
==========================

=> package means a software

	Ex: git, maven, java, python etc...

=> Package Managers are used to install / update / manage software packages in linux machines.

=> Package managers are specific to linux distribution.

	amazon linux / Red Hat Linux / Cent OS : yum

	ubuntu / debian : apt


# check git client installed or not
git -version

# install git client s/w
sudo yum install git

# check git installation path
whereis git

# check java version
java -version

# check java path
whereis java

# install java
sudo yum install java

======================================================
Assignment : Remove git and java from linux machine

=============================
Webserver Setup in Linux VM
============================

=> Webserver is a software which is used to run websites.

=> Website means collection of web pages

	ex: login page, register page, dashboard page, about us page ....

=> Websites are divided into 2 types

		1) Static website
		2) Dynamic website

=> The website which gives same response for every user is called as static website.

=> The website which gives response based on logged in user is called as dynamic website.

=> To run static websites we can use 'httpd' as webserver.

=> To run dynamic websites we can use 'tomcat, iis' as webservers.


# install httpd webserver
sudo yum install httpd -y

# check webserver status
sudo service httpd status

# start httpd server
sudo service httpd start

Note: httpd webserver runs on http protocol with 80 port number.

Note: To access our webserver we need to enable http protocol in ec2 vm security group inbound rules.

=> Once http protocol enabled we can access our webserver using ec2-linux-vm public ip

# navigate to website content directory
cd /var/www/html

# create a file with a name : index.html and write the content
sudo vi index.html


================================
Static website hostig in linux
================================

# install webserver
$ sudo yum install httpd

# start webserver
$ sudo service httpd start

# Navigate to website content directory
$ cd /var/www/html

# create index.html file with website content
$ sudo vi index.html


Note: httpd webserver runs on 80 port number.

=> To access our webserver we need to enable 80 port number in security group inbound rules.

=> We can access our webserver using ec2-vm public ip.


================================
What is systemctl in linux ?
================================

=> systemctl is used to manage services in linux machines.

=> using systemctl we can perform below operations

	a) start a service
	b) stop a service
	c) restart a service
	d) enable/disable service

# stop httpd server
sudo systemctl stop httpd

# start httpd server
sudo systemctl start httpd

# reload service
sudo systemctl reload http

====================================================

uptime : from when our linux vm is running

free : to display memory details

top : display running processes

htop : display running process in table format

Q) How to check linux os version ?
Ans) cat /etc/os-release

Q) How to check linux kernel version ?
Ans) uname -r

===========================
Working with Link Files
===========================

=> In linux we can create link files ( similar to shorcut files in windows )

=> We have 2 types of link files in linux

	1) Hard link
	2) Soft link (symbolic link)

--------------------------------
Syntax To create Hard Link
--------------------------------

$ ln <orginal-file> <link-file>

$ touch f1.txt

# create link file
$ ln f1.txt f100.txt

Note: f100.txt is link file for f1.txt

# print files along with inode numbers
# ls -li

Note: If we write some data to original file, it is reflecting in link file also.

Note: when we delete original file, link file is not effected (hard link).


------------------------------
Syntax To create Soft Link 
------------------------------

$ ln -s <orginal-file> <soft-link-file>

Ex:

$ touch s1.txt

$ ln -s s1.txt s100.txt

$ ls -li

Note: Original file and link file having diff inode numbes

$ cat >> s1.txt

Note: Original file data reflecting in link file also.

$ rm s1.txt

Note: When we remove original file then soft link file will become dangling file. 
     We can't access that file.


=====================
process management
=====================

Process management in Linux involves controlling and monitoring the execution of programs (processes) on the system. 

# display processing running
$ ps aux

Note: Every process will process id (PID)

$ kill PID

# terminate process immediatley (forcefully)
$ kill -9 PID

=============================================
How to change hostname in vm (temporarly) ?
=============================================

# set hostname
$ sudo hostname <new-name>

# re-start session 
$ exit 

Note: connect back to vm then we can see configured hostname

===================================
How to set hostname permanentley
===================================

# update hostname in below file
$ sudo vi /etc/hostname

# restart the vm

Note: After restart hostname configured in file will be reflected in terminal.
