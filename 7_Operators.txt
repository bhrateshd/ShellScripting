Comparison Operators

	Equal to: -eq or == :checks if two values are equal.
	[ $a -eq $b ]
	
	Greater Than or Equal to: -ge:Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
	[ $a -ge $b ]
	
	Less Than or Equal to: -le: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to right.
	[ $a -le $b ]
	
	Not Equal to: -ne or !=:Checks if the two values are not equal.
	[ $a -ne $b ]
	
	Greater Than: -gt: Checks if the left operand is greater than ghe right.
	[ $a -gt $b ]
	
	Less Than: -lt: Checks if the legft operand is less than the right.
	[ $a -lt $b ]
	

Logical Operators

	Using && (AND) Operator:
	
	a=10
	b=5
	if [ $a -gt 5 ] && [ $b -lt 10 ]; then
		echo "Both conditions are true"
	else
		echo "One or both conditions are false"
	fi
	
	
	Using || (OR) Operator
	
	a=10
	b=15
	if [ $a -gt 5 ] || [ $b -lt 10 ]; then
		echo "At least one condition is true"
	else
		echo "Neither condition is true"
	fi
	
	
	Combining && and || Operators:
	
	a=10
	b=5
	c=15
	
	if [$a -gt 5 ] && [ $b -lt 10 ] || [ $c -eq 15 ]; then
		echo "Condition met"
	else
		echo "Condition not met"
	fi
	
Explanation:
	The&&ensuresbothconditions must be true.
	The||checksthesecondcondition if the first fails.
	
	
	Ternary Operator (One-liner If-Else)
	
	A simple way to write an if-else statement in one line:
		a=10
		[ $a-gt 5 ] && echo "Greater" || echo "Not Greater"

Explanation:
	If $a -gt 5 is true,it prints "Greater".
	Otherwise, it prints "Not Greater".
